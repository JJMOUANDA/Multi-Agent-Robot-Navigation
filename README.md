# Multi-Agent-Robot-Navigation
This project simulates autonomous e-puck robots using a multi-agent system (MAS) in Webots. Agents navigate unknown environments, avoid obstacles, and find a hidden target with varying levels of autonomy. It includes developing reactive and cognitive agents, testing their performance, and evaluating their efficiency in obstacle-laden scenarios.
